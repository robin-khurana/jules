# Backend Architecture Design for Ride-Hailing Application

This document outlines the architectural decisions for building a scalable backend for a ride-hailing application.

## 1. Language and Framework
- **Language:** Go
- **Framework:** Gin

## 2. API Design
- **Style:** RESTful APIs
- **Data Format:** JSON for request and response bodies.
- **Authentication:** Token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Core Resources:** Users (Riders/Drivers), Rides, Driver Profiles, Payments, Ratings.
- **Key Functionalities Planned:** User registration/login, ride requests, driver matching (conceptual), ride status updates, fare calculation, payment processing, user ratings.
- **Potential Advanced Features:** Scheduled rides, fare estimates, promo codes, multiple stops, emergency SOS, driver destination, ride preferences, lost & found, business profiles, dynamic pricing, tipping, in-app chat.

## 3. Database
- **Type:** NoSQL Document Database
- **Choice:** MongoDB
- **Schema Outline:**
    - `users`: Stores rider and driver information (auth details, profile, userType).
    - `driversProfile`: Specific details for drivers (availability, vehicle info, currentLocation with GeoJSON for 2dsphere indexing).
    - `rides`: Details of each ride (riderId, driverId, pickup/destination locations with GeoJSON, status, fare).
    - `ratings`: Ratings and comments for rides/users.
    - `payments`: Payment transaction details for rides.
- **Key Considerations:** Use of MongoDB's geospatial capabilities for location-based queries. Multi-document ACID transactions for critical operations.

## 4. Caching
- **Mechanism:** Redis
- **Strategies:**
    - Cache-aside for user profiles and other frequently accessed, less volatile data.
    - Short TTL caching for results of nearby driver queries.
    - Caching fare estimates for common routes.
    - Storing application configuration or master data.
    - JWT blacklisting for session management.

## 5. Task Queue
- **System:** RabbitMQ
- **Use Cases:**
    - Sending notifications (push, SMS, email).
    - Post-ride processing (generating receipts, final fare adjustments, updating stats).
    - Asynchronous data aggregation or analytics tasks.
    - Interactions with third-party services.

## 6. Containerization
- **Tool:** Docker
- **Approach:**
    - Multi-stage Dockerfiles for creating lean Go application images.
    - Docker Compose for managing local development environments (Go app, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ).

## 7. Orchestration
- **Target Platform:** Kubernetes (K8s)
- **Rationale:** For automated deployment, scaling, high availability, and fault tolerance in production.
- **Consideration:** Managed serverless container platforms (e.g., Google Cloud Run, AWS App Runner) as a simpler starting point for initial deployments.
- **Artifacts:** Kubernetes manifest files (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets).

## 8. Logging and Monitoring
- **Logging:**
    - **Application:** Structured logging (JSON) in Go services (using libraries like `zap` or `logrus`).
    - **Collection:** Fluentd or Promtail.
    - **Storage & Analysis:** Elasticsearch or Loki.
    - **Visualization:** Kibana or Grafana.
- **Monitoring:**
    - **Metrics Collection:** Prometheus (`prometheus/client_golang` in Go apps for exposing `/metrics`).
    - **Storage & Alerting:** Prometheus server with Alertmanager.
    - **Visualization:** Grafana dashboards.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Considered for future enhancement (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin).

## 9. Testing
- **Strategy:** Combination of Unit and Integration Tests.
- **Unit Tests:**
    - Using Go's built-in `testing` package.
    - Mocking dependencies (interfaces, libraries like `testify/mock` or `gomock`).
    - Focus on individual functions and business logic.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Testing interactions between components (e.g., API handlers with database and cache).
    - May use Docker Compose to spin up dependent services (MongoDB, Redis) for tests.
- **Automation:** Aim for CI/CD pipeline integration for automated test execution.

This design provides a foundation for a robust, scalable, and maintainable backend system.
